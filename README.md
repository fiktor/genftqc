# GenFTQC
## Goals
The goals of this project are:
* Create an agent which can solve a variety of tasks related to FTQC.
* Create an environment for training and evaluating this agent.
* Compare the agent with existing approaches (e.g. `CodeT5+`, `VeriGen+MCTS`).
* Improve the agent until its performance exceeds the SOTA.
* Compare the improved agent to the SOTA and write an ML paper on that.
* Also, write a physics paper.
